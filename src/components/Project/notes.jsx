      My first project using TypeScript in React. It's an enjoyable and educational project, but it comes 
      with some challenges. Implementing the game logic,such as checking if a guessed letter is correct and adjusting the game state 
      accordingly. Another challenge involves managing the game's various aspects, like 
      keeping track of the word to guess, the letters that have been guessed, and the 
      number of incorrect guesses. Overall, it is a fun project to work on.
